# RWD-Repo
A code repo for Arduino code written to control the Robot

This robot consists of three main modules:
* Bluetooth
* Master Control
* Motor Control

Circuitry diagrams will hopefully soon follow to show anyone who discovers this repository what the actual build situation is.

## Libraries Required
